# Express and Websocket

## Description

This project is a real-time data visualization application built using Express.js for the backend API and WebSocket for communication.
It sends random data from the server to the frontend every 5 seconds, which is then displayed as a dynamic bar chart.
This allows users to see live updates of the data without needing to refresh the page.
